# SpinGlassPEPSbenchmarks

This works with CUDA v4.4.1. You need to manually install 
a newer version of `TransmuteDims`: `]add TransmuteDims#strided2`

This repository contains benchmarks used for projects:
- SpinGlassTensors.jl (`tensors` folder)
- SpinGlassNetworks.jl (`networks` folder)
- SpinGlassEngine.jl (`engine` folder)
